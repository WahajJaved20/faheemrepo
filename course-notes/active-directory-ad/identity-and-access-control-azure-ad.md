# Identity and Access Control (Azure AD)

Identity and access control refers to the processes and mechanisms used to manage and secure digital resources within a system or organization. It involves verifying the identity of users and determining what actions they are allowed to perform within the system.

Azure AD single sign on ,enables users to sign in once and access various applications without needing to authenticate separately for each one

## Components of IAC:

**Authentication:** This is the process of verifying the identity of a user like using a password, fingerprint, or security token

**Authorization:** Determines what actions a user is allowed to perform based on their role, permissions, and privileges.

**Access Control:** Enforces authorization policies to restrict access to resources according to predefined rules, including network, file system, and application-level controls.

**Role-based Access Control (RBAC):** Assigns access rights to users based on their roles in an organization

**Attribute-based Access Control (ABAC):** Access decisions based on user attributes, resource attributes, and environment.This allows for more fine-grained control over access permissions.

**Centralized Identity Management:** Systems like Active Directory or LDAP manage user identities and access policies across an organization's IT

**Auditing and Logging:** logging is essential for maintaining security and compliance, and auditing tracks who accessed what resource and when, enabling them to detect and respond to security incidents or policy violations.
