# Hybrid Cloud Security (CloudNox)

**Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Establish strong identity and access management policies to control user access across on-premises and cloud environments.

**Data Encryption**: Safeguard sensitive data by encrypting it while stored and in transit, preventing unauthorized access or interception.

**Network Security**: Implement measures like network segmentation, firewalls, and IDS/IPS to monitor and control traffic between on-premises and cloud environments.

**Cloud Security Posture Management (CSPM)**: Use CSPM tools to evaluate and enforce security best practices for cloud workloads, storage, and networking configurations, identifying and addressing misconfigurations and vulnerabilities.

**Threat Detection and Response**: Deploy security monitoring, logging, and analytics to identify and respond to security threats across hybrid cloud environments, leveraging machine learning and AI for anomaly detection.

**Compliance and Governance:** Ensure compliance with industry regulations and organizational policies by implementing governance frameworks and controls spanning on-premises and cloud environments.

**Incident Response and Disaster Recovery:** Develop incident response plans and procedures that encompass both on-premises and cloud environments.
