  * This document outlines the procedures, roles, and responsibilities of the incident response team
* **Conduct regular training and drills:** Ensure that the team is well-prepared to respond to various types of incidents.

## 2) Identification

* **Detect and classify incidents:** Use security tools and monitoring systems to identify unusual or suspicious activities that may indicate a security incident.
* **Establish baselines:** Understand normal network behavior to better identify anomalies.

## 3) Containment

* Isolate affected systems
* Prevent further damage by limiting its impact on other parts of the network.
* **Disable compromised accounts or services:** Take immediate action to stop the spread of the incident.

## 4) Eradication

* **Remove the root cause:** Identify and eliminate the source of the incident to prevent its recurrence.
* **Patch vulnerabilities:** Address security weaknesses and apply necessary updates to prevent similar incidents in the future.

## 5) Recovery

* **Restore affected systems:** Bring affected systems and services back to normal operation.
* **Validate system integrity:** Ensure that restored systems are free of malware and other malicious artifacts.

## 6) Lessons Learnt

* **Conduct a post-incident analysis:** Analyze the incident, the response process, and the effectiveness of the actions taken.
* **Document lessons learned:** Capture insights and recommendations for improving the incident response plan and overall security posture.

## 7) Communication
