# Extended Detection and Response (XDR)

an integrated security solution of multiple security components designed to provide advanced threat detection and response capabilities across various security layers within an organization

Example: MISP + Splunk + Qradar

## How does XDR Work?

### 1) Data Analysis:

XDR collects data from several security points, including endpoints, networks, servers, and the cloud.

Upon data aggregation, it performs data analysis to correlate context from various alerts that are generated.

**This saves security teams from dealing with large volumes of security alerts and lets them zero in on high-priority signals or alerts.**

### 2) Threat Detection:

XDR offers excellent visibility into an organizationâ€™s IT infrastructure.

This allows the system to examine signs of any detected threat and report the critical ones requiring a response.&#x20;

The visibility factor also enables companies to deep dive into the abnormal behavior of threats and investigate their origins before affecting other parts of the system.

### 3) Attack Response:

In the last step, XDR primarily contains and removes any detected threats.&#x20;

Subsequently, it updates security policies to ensure that a similar incident does not reoccur in the near future.

## Key Components:

### 1) Integration with Everything

XDR solutions possess strong API-centric integration capabilities. XDR also needs to query any tool in the security stack for additional data and context and subsequently receive the data feed. Additionally, XDR also initiates immediate responses upon threat detection without requiring analysts to log in to another tool.

### 2) Simplified Response Automation

Automation in XDR allows better threat detection and speeds up response outcomes. Security incidents such as malware or phishing attacks tend to repeat themselves. **Response automation standardizes incident response based on the predefined playbook logic and delivers effective resolutions for known offenses.**

### 3) AI/ML Modules

With AI techniques, mathematical calculations are made on the fly to assess the threat and risk probability. Additionally, the XDR system learns about a specific environment, determines what modules to configure, and how to do it effectively.

### 4) Deep Analytics

A successful XDR deployment can distinguish between actual threats and false positives without letting the real attacks escape. This can enable the XDR to deliver deep threat detection and consequently generate an appropriate threat response.

### 5) Inexpensive & extensible data layer

Traditional SIEM storages are expensive as they are primarily built on outdated architectures. This is because the system finds it difficult to segregate near-term data necessary for threat detection and older historical data that aids in standardizing past threat trends.

An effective XDR can differentiate between the two data sources and, at the same time, employ low-cost methods to retain historical data records.

### 6) Flexible Deployment

An XDR solution supports flexible deployments. It may be an on-premise and cloud-based implementation or managed deployments where organizations lack the requisite resources to manage them independently.
