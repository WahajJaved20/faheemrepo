# Security Orchestration, Automation and Response (SOAR)

A framework designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of security operations. It involves the integration of security tools, automation of repetitive tasks, and orchestration of incident response processes.

## Incident Handling with SOAR

### Detection

An intrusion detection system (IDS) identifies suspicious activity on the network and generates an <mark style="color:red;">alert</mark> indicating a potential security incident.

### Alert Ingestion

The alert is ingested into the SOAR platform, which acts as a central hub for managing security incidents.

### Alert Enrichment

The SOAR platform automatically enriches the alert with additional context, such as IP geolocation, threat intelligence, and historical data.

### Analysis

Security analysts receive a prioritized and enriched alert. The SOAR platform provides suggestions for investigation based on previous incidents and threat intelligence.

### Automated Investigation

Routine investigative tasks, such as checking logs, searching databases, and correlating data, are automated by the SOAR platform. This accelerates the analysis process.

### Decision Making

The SOAR platform provides the analysts with a comprehensive view of the incident, including its severity, potential impact, and recommended response actions.

### Notification and Collaboration

Automated notifications are sent to relevant stakeholders, including IT teams, incident responders, and management. Collaboration tools within the SOAR platform facilitate communication and coordination.

### Documentation and Reporting

The SOAR platform logs all actions taken during the incident response process. This information is used for post-incident analysis, compliance reporting, and continuous improvement.

### Feedback Loop

Insights from the incident response process are used to improve and update playbooks, ensuring that the SOAR platform becomes more effective over time.
