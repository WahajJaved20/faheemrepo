### Preparation:

* Make sure that the organization has an internal process in place to respond to any sort of incidents.
* we also need to have preventative steps set up in case of attacks.

### Identification:

* Who or what reported the event?
* How did it happen?
* How was it discovered?
* Scope of the incident?
* Impact on business operations.

#### Precursors -> Signs that an incident may occur in the future but hasn't happened yet.

#### Indicators -> Signs that an incident has already occurred or is happening.

### Containment:

Try to minimize the spread of threat to prevent additional damage.

* Should we shut down the system entirely?
* Can we contain it using sandboxing.
* Should we disconnect the threat from the main network?

### Eradication:

Try to eliminate the components related to the incident.

* Remove Installed Malware
* Closing Down the vulnerabilities that caused the incident.
* Implement Patches.

### Recovery:

Setting the systems back to normal after elimination of all the vulnerabilities.

* Restore from trusted backups.
* ensure backups were not infected.
* patch and update systems.
* Thoroughly test to ensure that their are no vulnerabilities.

### Lessons Learned:

Also known as the Post Incident Activity.

* What can we learn from this and how can we prevent this.
* How can we better respond to an incident next time?
