# Threat Hunters

**Threat hunting is the practice of proactively searching for cyber threats that are lurking undetected in a network.** Cyber threat hunting digs deep to find malicious actors in your environment that have slipped past your initial endpoint security defenses.

After sneaking in, an attacker can stealthily remain in a network for months as they quietly collect data, look for confidential material, or obtain login credentials.

## Threat Hunting Steps:

### 1) The Trigger

**A trigger** points threat hunters to a specific system or area of the network for further investigation when advanced detection tools identify unusual actions that may indicate malicious activity.&#x20;

### 2) The Investigation

During the **investigation phase**, the threat hunter uses technology such as EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) to take a deep dive into potential malicious compromise of a system. The investigation continues until either the activity is deemed benign or a complete picture of the malicious behavior has been created.

### 3) The Resolution

**The resolution phase** involves communicating relevant malicious activity intelligence to operations and security teams so they can respond to the incident and mitigate threats.

The data gathered about both malicious and benign activity can be fed into automated technology to improve its effectiveness without further human intervention.
